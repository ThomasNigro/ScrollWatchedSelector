ScrollWatchedSelector
=====================

This solution has an extended ListView and GridView controls that fire an event called "GoingToTopOrBottom" (yeah, the name is really crap). This event is fired, well, when the user scrolls to the top or the bottom of the listview/gridview.
It is used in VLC for Windows Phone, I made it really quick, any improvement is welcomed.
